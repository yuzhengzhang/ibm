# Personalized Recommendations

  Personalized Recommendations is a tool that helps you find the best vacation spots to go to.  This app uses three Watson:
  * [Concept Insights](http://www.ibm.com/smarterplanet/us/en/ibmwatson/developercloud/concept-insights.html) searches for your relevant places.
  * [Tradeoff Analytics](http://www.ibm.com/smarterplanet/us/en/ibmwatson/developercloud/tradeoff-analytics.html) helps decide which place is best.
  * [Question and Answer](http://www.ibm.com/smarterplanet/us/en/ibmwatson/developercloud/question-answer.html) answers your questions about those places.
